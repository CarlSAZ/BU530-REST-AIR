# fixtures work by defining steps to setup a required environment for
# test functions. They can be called in the input arguments, and pytest
# will execute the fixture code during the argument passing (I think)
# yield seems to be used so that a code block after it executes after the test
# function calling it is complete.
# Other thing to note: The name argument in the pytest.fixture(name="foo") should match
# the argument in the other functions to be used. By defualt, this is the same as the fixture's 
# function name. But that results in pytest giving warnings about overriding... So this way is 
# more pythonic.
